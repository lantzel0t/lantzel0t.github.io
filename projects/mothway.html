        <p>A solo game-jam project. This one took place over a weekend, with the theme of <i>light</i>. It was
            constructed entirely using the three.js library, which is a very bare-bones 3d engine. There isn't
            a great visual editor for three.js, so all development of the game took place within the IDE outside of
            modelling the lightbulbs. An interesting detail is that the moths are primitive spheres, flattened and
            rotated rapidly to give the appearance of flapping wings. I chose the browser as the platform for the game
            as I planned from the start to keep it simple and make it as easy as possible for anyone to try it out. I
            also wanted to challenge myself, so three.js felt more fitting as opposed to just exporting a Unity project
            to html.</p>
